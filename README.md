# wtf?

this is probably even long overdue. simply explained; i, and a tiny group of people dont like the way vee is handling the community nor the project itself. im guessing its a lot of pressure for vee. im not disrespecting anything that they have done for the community, but i no longer agree with their takes and decisions.

<summary>Using any client modification violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!
